Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Niklas!

I've experience in many software engineering areas. Worked on multiple websites, mobile applications - backend & frontend and databases. Worked with barebone linux servers, and also cloud managing services like Kubernetes.

Loves to explore new and modern technologies to make little tools and micro services for the most different areas of application.

Favorite areas, technologies & frameworks:
Python, FastAPI, Docker, Symfony (PHP), Swift for iOS & macOS, JetBrains IDEs, Dev&ChatOps (CI/CD, Actions)
